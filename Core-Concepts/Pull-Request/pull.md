### Pull Request

#### Creating Pull Requests
A pull request proposes changes from one branch to another and facilitates code review and discussion. It is a key feature of collaborative workflows.

#### Code Review
Code review involves examining the proposed changes in a pull request. Reviewers provide feedback, request changes, or approve the changes.

#### Approving Changes
Reviewers can approve changes in a pull request, indicating that the changes are satisfactory and ready to be merged.

#### Requesting Changes
Reviewers can request changes if they find issues or improvements needed in the pull request. The author must address these before merging.

#### Merging
Merging integrates the changes from a pull request into the target branch. This can be done after the pull request is approved and any conflicts are resolved.
