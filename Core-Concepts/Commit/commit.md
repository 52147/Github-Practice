### Commit

#### Commit Message
A commit message is a brief description of the changes made in that commit. It helps track and understand the history of changes.

#### SHA-1 Hash
Each commit is assigned a unique SHA-1 hash that identifies it. This hash ensures the integrity of the commit.

#### Staging Changes
Staging involves selecting changes to be included in the next commit using the `git add` command. It allows precise control over what gets committed.

#### Amend Commit
Amending a commit allows you to modify the most recent commit. This can be done with `git commit --amend`.

#### Reverting Commits
Reverting creates a new commit that undoes the changes of a specified previous commit using the `git revert` command.
