### Merge

#### Merge Conflicts
Merge conflicts occur when there are conflicting changes in the branches being merged. These must be resolved manually.

#### Merge Strategies
Different strategies can be used to merge changes:

- **Merge**: Combines all commits from the source branch into the target branch with a merge commit.
- **Squash**: Combines all commits into a single commit before merging.
- **Rebase**: Reapplies commits from the source branch on top of the target branch, creating a linear history.
