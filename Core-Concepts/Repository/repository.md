### Repository

#### Local Repository
A local repository is a version of your project stored on your local machine. It allows you to manage and track changes offline.

#### Remote Repository
A remote repository is a version of your project hosted on a server, such as GitHub. It enables collaboration by allowing multiple users to push and pull changes.

#### Cloning Repositories
Cloning creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine, including all its files, branches, and commits. Use the `git clone` command to do this.

#### Forking Repositories
Forking creates a personal copy of someone else's repository on GitHub. This is useful for making changes without affecting the original project.
