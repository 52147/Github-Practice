### Branch

#### Main/Master
The main (or master) branch is the default branch of a repository. It is often considered the production-ready branch.

#### Feature Branch
A feature branch is used to develop a specific feature or enhancement. It helps isolate changes from the main branch.

#### Release Branch
A release branch is used to prepare for a new production release. It typically involves final testing and bug fixes.

#### Hotfix Branch
A hotfix branch is created to quickly fix critical bugs in the production code. It allows urgent fixes to be applied without disrupting ongoing development.

#### Creating Branches
Branches can be created using the `git branch` command followed by the branch name, or by `git checkout -b` to create and switch to a new branch simultaneously.

#### Deleting Branches
Branches can be deleted using the `git branch -d` command for branches that have been merged, or `git branch -D` to force delete.
